- SSP population and GDP (gridded, aggregated to global):
  Zhang, C., et al. (2022). Gridded datasets for population and economy under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways for 2020–2100. Advances in Climate Change Research, 18(3): 381–383. doi:10.12006/j.issn.1673-1719.2022.106
  Units:
    * Population: millions of persons (as provided; converted to persons in long CSV).
    * GDP: billion USD (2010 price PPP) [international dollars].

- Price-year rebasing (2010 PPP -> 2020 PPP):

  Method: Annual average CPI in 2020 divided by annual average CPI in 2010 gives a conversion factor applied uniformly to the 2010-PPP GDP series to express in 2020-PPP dollars.
  Factor used: 1.186996974298735
